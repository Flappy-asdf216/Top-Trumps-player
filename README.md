# Top-Trumps-player
These programs allow for automating top trumps (the game).
Running the script for the relative deck, and enter the name of your card.
Next, the program will print each value on the card, and what the percentage chance of beating the deck is.
For example it may tell you that playing height has a 65.34% chance of winning.
This is calculated by seeing how many cards in the deck your card will defeat with your chosen value.

Please also find .csv files which have the datasets for the project.

The project is fairly malleable, the work is adding csv files for each deck. If you have any sets please feel free to upload these csvs!

Thanks!
